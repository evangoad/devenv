# dotfiles

All files in this directory `name.symlink` will be symlinked to your $HOME directory as `.name`.  

After you fork this repo, feel free to make `.symlink` versions of all the dotfiles you have in your home directory: 

```bash
ls -a $HOME
```

After you've moved your dotfiles into this directory, you'll need to run the interactive script to create new symlinks for new dotfiles:

```bash
devie -l 
```
